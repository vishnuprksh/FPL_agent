# FPL Analyst Tool

A comprehensive Fantasy Premier League (FPL) analysis tool that provides data-driven transfer and chip recommendations based on strict mathematical formulas and step-by-step analysis.

## Features

ðŸŽ¯ **Comprehensive Analysis**
- 8-step structured analysis process with completion tracking
- Mathematical formulas for fixture ease and predicted points
- Transfer evaluation with cost-benefit analysis
- Chip recommendation with numeric thresholds

ðŸ“Š **Data-Driven Insights**
- Player watchlist generation by position
- Current team analysis with weak link identification
- Linear regression modeling for point predictions
- Rotation risk assessment based on minutes played

ðŸ’° **Transfer Recommendations**
- Free transfer suggestions
- 4-point and 8-point hit evaluations
- Budget and squad composition validation
- Net uplift calculations

ðŸŽ® **Chip Analysis**
- Triple Captain recommendations (â‰¥15 point threshold)
- Bench Boost analysis (â‰¥15 point threshold)
- Wildcard evaluation (â‰¥40 point boost threshold)
- Free Hit recommendations (â‰¥15 point boost threshold)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishnuprksh/FPL_agent.git
cd FPL_agent
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Interactive Web Interface (Recommended)

Run the Streamlit web application:
```bash
streamlit run fpl_analyst.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

**Features:**
- Upload your current squad via CSV, manual entry, or text import
- Configure analysis parameters (prediction week, planning horizon)
- Generate comprehensive analysis reports
- Download analysis as markdown file

### Command Line Interface

For basic analysis and testing:
```bash
python3 analysis.py
```

### Generate Sample Analysis

To test the tool with sample data:
```bash
python3 test_analysis.py
```

This will generate a sample `FPL_analysis.md` report using a test squad.

## Input Methods

### Option 1: Current Squad Input
Provide your existing 15-player squad with:
- Player names, positions, clubs, and current prices
- Team status: Bank amount, free transfers available, chips remaining

### Option 2: New Squad Builder
Build a new squad from the watchlist with:
- Total budget constraint
- Maximum players per club
- Formation requirements (GK/DEF/MID/FWD distribution)

## Analysis Output

The tool generates a comprehensive `FPL_analysis.md` report containing:

### Step 1: Key Metrics and Parameters
- Definitions and formulas for all calculations

### Step 2: Watchlist 
- Top 10 players per position by predicted points per million
- Recent form data and fixture difficulty ratings

### Step 3: Current Team Analysis
- Individual player analysis with predicted points
- Identification of 3 weakest links

### Step 4: Transfer Evaluation
- Comparison of weak links with watchlist replacements
- Transfer cost analysis and net uplift calculations

### Step 5: Recommendations
- Prioritized transfer suggestions (free, 4-hit, 8-hit)
- Cost-benefit analysis for each option

### Step 6: Chip Analysis
- Evaluation of all available chips with numeric thresholds
- Clear recommendations based on projected gains

### Step 7: Verification & Assumptions
- Data freshness confirmation
- Assumptions and limitations documented

### Step 8: Next Week Watchlist
- Key players to monitor for future weeks
- Reasoning based on form, fixtures, and tactical changes

## Data Source

The tool uses historical FPL data from the `fpl_data.csv` file, containing:
- Player performance data from 2016/17 to 2023/24 seasons
- Match statistics, points, values, and team information
- 185,000+ records for comprehensive analysis

## Key Formulas

### Fixture Ease Calculation
```
FixtureEase = (5.00 - FDR) / 4.00
```

### Predicted Points (Linear Regression)
```
PredictedPoints = max(0.00, a + b * FixtureEase)
where a = y_mean - b * x_mean
      b = Î£((x_i - x_mean)(y_i - y_mean)) / Î£((x_i - x_mean)Â²)
```

### Points Per Million
```
PointsPerMillion = PredictedPoints_3GW Ã· Price
```

### Transfer Net Uplift
```
NetUplift = PredictedPoints(new) - PredictedPoints(outgoing) - TransferCostPoints
```
